## What the hell is this?
It is an opinionated simple web app to use the kindle as an pomodoro timer.

## Why don't just use phone for pomodoro timer instead?
1. kindle uses a e-ink display thus it doesn't hurts your eyes like your phone.
2. Mobiles phones are very distracting.
3. You would probaly going to spend more times looking for your pefect pomodoro timer app to actually sit down and work a timer.

## Why only two timers? 
I've intentionally given only two timer option because anything less than 25 minutes is too short to get done any real work that needs a timer and anything longer than 50 minutes you are just simply working too much without taking a break thus having a lower level of focus intensity and taking way longer to rechange the focus battery. 

## Why no stopwatch?
It doesn't work.

## How do I use it?
Open your browser in kindle and go to `jim8pu.github.io/Kindle-Clock.-/`.
